# Grate

> It'll be grate

## About

Grate is a GraphQL framework inspired by Rails. Grate aims to make
writing GraphQL APIs as simple and consistent as possible. Therefore,
Grate applies the principles of least surprise and developer happiness.

Grate adapts Rails' MVC architecture to GraphQL, in the form of MTC:
Model Type Controller. On top of this, Grate utilizes Ruby's
metaprogramming features to add a domain specific language that allows
you to automatically make queries on certain types.

But enough buzzwords, what does Grate actually do? Basically, Grate
lets you write: 
```
class PostType < GraphQL::Schema::Object
# Usual GraphQL Ruby stuff...
	queryable_on :title, String
end
```

And Grate will automatically generate a `postByTitle(title: String)`
query! Want more complicated queries? Grate lets you define the
signature in the type file, then write the corresponding code in the
controller and model.
