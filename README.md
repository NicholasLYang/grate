# Grate

> It'll be grate

Grate is a GraphQL framework inspired by Rails. Grate aims to make
writing GraphQL APIs as simple and consistent as possible. Therefore,
Grate applies the principles of least surprise and developer happiness.

But enough buzzwords, what does Grate actually do? Grate uses
Ruby's metaprogramming features to add a domain specific language that
allows you to automatically make queries on certain types.

For instance, if you have an Article type, you can write `queryable_on
:title, String` and Grate will automatically create an
`ArticleByTitle` query for you!

## Installation

You can install grate using the following:

    $ gem install grate
	
To generate a new project, make a directory, then run

    $ grate new NAME
	
All the necessary files will be generated.

## Development

Grate is build using Rack, so all you have to do to run your Grate application is run 

    $ rackup
